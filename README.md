The rack is placed on a carpeted floor, and there is a couch nearby, suggesting that the setup is in a living or entertainment area.<br><br>**What is behind the stand?**<br>Behind the stand, there is a brick wall. |

## About

Moondream is a highly efficient open-source vision language model that combines powerful image understanding capabilities with a remarkably small footprint. It's designed to be versatile and accessible, capable of running on a wide range of devices and platforms.

The project offers two model variants:

- **Moondream 2B**: The primary model with 2 billion parameters, offering robust performance for general-purpose image understanding tasks including captioning, visual question answering, and object detection.
- **Moondream 0.5B**: A compact 500 million parameter model specifically optimized as a distillation target for edge devices, enabling efficient deployment on resource-constrained hardware while maintaining impressive capabilities.

## How to use

Moondream can be run locally, or in the cloud. Please refer to the [Getting Started](https://moondream.ai/c/docs/quickstart) page for details.
